I've started itching (somewhat literally) to put a fly trap in the house. The back yard opens up to a corn field with some swampy irrigation and all sorts of flies and mosquitos are making their way in

Wall sconce, UV light and fan plus glue trap. Could be convinced to use some sort of zapper instead of glue, would welcome recommendations there.

Anyone have experience with that to get or not to get?

* **Must be able to run for longer periods** without overheating or burning out
* **Needs to handle frozen berries, ice, nuts, etc. easily**
* And most importantly: **no leaks** – the cups/lids should be solid and tight

I even tried some **aftermarket 950ml cups from China**, but they leaked badly – juice ran into the motor base and ruined everything.

I'd probably throw it on here as a BIFL recommendation in its own right - but I just found out it's been discontinued and I'm shattered. I was hoping to buy another color or two just to mix it up. I still might grab one from Patagonia's 2nd hand section if I can't find any other recommendations here.

I've been looking around the internet, on this sub and elsewhere, for high quality wool (merino?) alternatives, rather than the synthetic wool-free-wool in the better sweater.

The closest I've found is the [Filson guide sweater](https://www.filson.com/products/henley-guide-sweater-peat-green) which seems like a solid BIFL choice - but I'm worried about layering it under anything with those wax canvas shoulders....

It's my favorite sweater, I've worn it weekly if not daily for the shoulder seasons and winter for the past several years and it still has a ton of life left in it.

I'd probably throw it on here as a BIFL recommendation in its own right - but I just found out it's been discontinued and I'm shattered. I was hoping to buy another color or two just to mix it up. I still might grab one from Patagonia's 2nd hand section if I can't find any other recommendations here.

I've been looking around the internet, on this sub and elsewhere, for high quality wool (merino?) alternatives, rather than the synthetic wool-free-wool in the better sweater.

The closest I've found is the [Filson guide sweater](https://www.filson.com/products/henley-guide-sweater-peat-green) which seems like a solid BIFL choice - but I'm worried about layering it under anything with those wax canvas shoulders....

A couple of my friends are getting married over the next few months, and as gifts, I'd like to put together ""fix it"" boxes for them, sort of a ~first aid kit for stuff~, if you will. Big fan of the ""use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without"" mindset, haha, and I love the idea of preparing a nice toolkit for it.

I'm looking for ideas/advice on what to include. The focus is on durable goods, but I'll be throwing in some consumables, like a set of small fabric patches in two dozen different shades and a little variety set of buttons and snaps, and open to other ideas especially if it's a consumable that won't go bad (as much as I want to, I don't think I could give them a lifetime supply of duct tape that wouldn't degrade, lol). Other items will be a utility knife set, a variety of sewing needles, a multimeter, an awl (as an aside, does anyone else find themselves constantly repunching holes in belts??), jewelry pliers, a tiny screwdriver set, zipties...

Thinking about maintenance/cleaning tools as well like suede brushes, one of those tools to get hair out of vacuum brushes, and things like that.

1l6i1f3,[Test] Thermal Retention Test of 2 Stanley Vacuum Insulated Vessels (with thermal model),https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6i1f3,41,3,1749404496.0,TeoZece,"I’ve always been curious how well insulated containers *actually* perform, so I set up a small experiment using two Stanley products:

* **Stanley Adventure Bottle 0.73L / 25 oz**
* **Stanley Classic Legendary Food Jar 0.4L / 14 oz**

Both had been used twice before the test. I preheated them by filling each with boiling water, giving them a shake, and letting them sit briefly to soak up some heat. I then replaced the water with **fresh boiling water**, sealed them—while carefully routing a temperature probe inside each lid—and started recording.

Each vessel had a probe connected to an external display to track internal temperature. An additional probe measured **ambient room temperature**.

After the internal temperature stabilized (within a few seconds), I started the timer and began capturing a **hyperlapse video** of the process. I logged temperatures regularly, especially for the food jar (which cooled faster), adding data every **0.5–1.0°C** of temperature drop (of the Food Jar).

I compiled the data into a Python script and applied a simple exponential cooling model:

T(t)=Troom+(Tstart−Troom)⋅exp(−t/τ)

Where:

* T(t) is the temperature inside the vessel at time ttt
* Troom​ is the ambient room temperature
* Tstart​ is the starting temperature (after stabilization)
* τ is the **time constant**, a parameter that describes how fast the temperature approaches the ambient

This formula assumes the rate of heat loss is proportional to the temperature difference between the contents and the environment. The higher the τ, the better the insulation.

Since τ can be unintuitive, I calculated the **thermal half-life t\_1/2​** instead:

t\_1/2 = τ⋅ln⁡(2)

Which leads to:  
T(t)=Troom+(Tstart−Troom)⋅0.5\^(−t/t\_1/2)

This gives the time it takes for the **temperature difference** between the vessel contents and ambient to reduce by half.

# Results

* **Stanley Adventure Bottle 0.73L**
   * t\_1/2 ≈ 21.5 hours
* **Stanley Food Jar 0.4L**
   * t\_1/2 ≈ 9 hours

So if you start with boiling water in the bottle, it’ll still be significantly warm after a full day. The food jar cools faster but is still decent for a lunch or short hike.

# Disclaimers

* The containers were **not opened at all** during the 30-hour test. In real use, opening would increase heat loss.
* The **probe wire** creates a tiny gap in the seal, which may or may not have affected insulation performance. I suspect it's minor, but worth noting.

* The larger the volume relative to the opening area, the better the heat retention tends to be.
* There are a few details how I calculated the time constant (removing too high/low values), but I am to lazy to go too deep into that.

**Tldr;**  
I tested how well two Stanley vacuum-insulated containers hold heat: the *Adventure Bottle 0.73L (25 oz)* and the *Classic Legendary Food Jar 0.4L (14 oz)*. I modeled their cooling with an exponential heat loss formula and calculated a ""thermal half-life"" to make the results easier to understand:

* **Adventure Bottle:** \~21.5 hours

This is a hard size to find, and the rug dealers I've found near Chicago want like 3-4K...

I abuse the heck out of them leaving them in the sink for quite a while at a time with food and water and they’ve held up excellently! 

I chose Lapis as my color of choice and they look just as good as they say I bought them. I love having them on display. I grew up with white Corelle, which is also BIFL, but is so boring and bland. Stoneware will break easier if you drop it compared to Corelle but I’ve never dropped or broken a plate so 🤷‍♂️. Fiestaware also has nice accents and textures on their dinnerware that classes them up a bit as well!

I decided to go with just one color since I’m going for a blue theme in my kitchen. Every time I eat on them they make me happy with their awesome color. It’d be fun to have a mix as well. I highly recommend going in person to Macys/Dillards/Kohls to make sure the color is what you’re after!

My recommendations:
- Bistro 3 piece set: The large plate, small plate, and small but deep bowl all get their uses. Small plates for just a burrito. The large plate for dinner. The deep bistro bowl for small bowls of cereal and salad. I definitely reach for all three for their own uses. Don’t get the classic rim bowl. It’s way too shallow.

- Gusto Bowl: I like having bigger bowls as well. I worried that it might be redundant having two sets of bowls but I use the small ones for smaller sides and eats, while the big gusto bowls are great for large salads, soups, and chilli. A can of soup will fit the gusto bowl perfectly but will overflow the bistro bowls. If you had to choose to save some money, then go with Gusto over the bistro bowl for sure. 

- Mugs - I got the 16oz bistro mugs. These have been perfect. I always want at least that much water/soda/coffee, so I highly recommend going big. Looks like the 16oz bistro mug got temporarily discontinued, so maybe look at the 16oz stackable mugs, but definitely go at least 16oz in my opinion. 

All in all, I highly recommend Fiestaware. It’s pricey but the color and quality are worth it. It’s made in America which is also nice as well!

As far as buying goes, always shoot for a sale. Black Friday I think usually has sales but I’m always seeing various sales throughout the year. What sparked me writing this review was a 30% sale at Macys that also applies to Fiestaware, so if you’re in the market this is a great time. Fiestaware also is running 15% off on their factory direct site if you need a piece that Macys doesn’t offer. So if you’re reading this in the future, shoot for a 15%-30% sale.

BUT-- this is not a post encouraging people to ""just buy it because if you don't like it you can donate it to a thrift store or sell it!"" I recently went with a friend who works at a local thrift store and they are totally overwhelmed with donations, most of which looks like stuff people bought less than a year ago. Also, selling stuff on depop/poshmark/ebay/etc isn't really environmentally friendly because of all that shipping that goes into it.

  
I'm not on Tiktok and minimally on other social media, so I usually don't know about microtrends until they start dying out.



I had a pair of doc marten vegan boots (which people said wouldn't last!) for about 9 years, and were still going pretty strong, but I was seriously downsizing for a major move and decided to replace them with an ""everything"" shoe so I could own less stuff.

  
I wanted the oxford-style docs in real leather with nonslip soles. They can be dressed up or down, fit my day-to-day style, act as my rain shoes, and I could get away with wearing them to my full time job as a restaurant server, whereas doc boots are sometimes seen as too casual/edgy for more formal dress codes. Instead of having dress shoes, work shoes, and casual/all-weather shoes, I could just have one pair! And I love them! They work for me and I've found that highly cushioned shoes make my feet cramp up and my lower back hurt. I can walk a lot of miles in those things. I did a lot of research on them to see what others thought of them for restaurant work, and it seems that front of house folks tend to like them, while most of the negative opinions came from back of house workers who do a lot of standing in one spot and deal with extremely slippery greasy floors-- which isn't what my shifts look like.

  
Turns out they were at one point a tiktok microtrend, and I got them on depop for half the price of buying them new! They definitely had not been worn more than once or twice, if at all.

  
I wear them at LEAST 4-5 times a week, am constantly spilling drinks on them, and stomp around (I have a HEAVY step) on literal concrete floors for 6+ hours and an average of about 5 miles/10,000 steps per shift. They're my rain and snow shoes (it snowed twice this year and it was only about 2 inches). It's been about a year and a half now, and there's some wearing of the lining in the heel which doesn't seem to be getting any worse so I think that's just how my feet ""break in"" shoes. It seems I only need to clean/condition them twice a year with a damp paper towel and a bit of wonder balsalm which I borrowed from a friend because that single can will probably last a lifetime, so why buy two?

  
Crazy to me, as a former alt-kid and current queer person, that docs could be a microtrend. In my mind, they're just... standard shoes... that have been staples within these subcultures for generations...

  
Also, ugg mini's are a former microtrend that I have been hoping to thrift for the past 2 years. It's SO funny to me that they're in every single de-influencing video ever made. I'm 26 and I still wear my ""chestnut"" tall uggs from 8th grade folded ALL the way down so they're super fluffy. The mini's just have the power to work with more styles of pants than the tall or regulars, and as much as I love my fluffy uggs, they are a very LOUD wardrobe piece. It will be much easier to get away with wearing ugg mini's in more \~serious\~ settings. Also, I'm nostalgic for dark brown uggs because my first pair of uggs from 4th grade were regular height in the ""chocolate"" color. I hate that the quality has definitely gone down since the 2000's and early 2010's, but something about the very specific (some would say ugly) shape of uggs just does something for my soul that the other brands of sheepskin boots cannot touch.

  
Another BIFL microtrend that's a forever & always for me is the selkie ""puff"" dress dupe. I had wanted a selkie dress since 2020, and got a dupe to wear to the eras tour in 2024. I also wore it to my grad school graduation. And to the wicked premier. And I wish I had more excuses to wear it like all the time. I never grew out of the dress-up princess phase. And if I got my grubby little paws on one of those viral strawberry dresses from a while back, I'd probably make it my entire personality until the day I die. Okay, now I'm just giving myself more reasons why I definitely need to commit to learning to sew.

  
Not sure if Chunks hair clips would be considered a microtrend, but I've been wanting a checkered claw clip since 2020. Had a cheap dupe from target that I got rid of during one of my moves because at that point I had cut my hair short and had no use for claw clips. Regrew my hair and have been using another target claw clip, which broke from simply leaning my head against the couch. Finally bit the bullet on buying a real chunks clip after 5 years of wanting them (they're made with a more flexible/durable material), and ended up getting the exact one I wanted on sale with the added 10% welcome discount. I recently nailed down ""my"" color palette of what looks and feels best with my natural coloring, and got the clip in those colors (which have been some of my favorite colors most of my life anyway), and I'm very pleased with this BIFL purchase that I finally got after being in love with for 5 whole years.","Would love to hear about others' BIFL items that have been part of the trend/microtrend cycle!

I had a pair of doc marten vegan boots (which people said wouldn't last!) for about 9 years, and were still going pretty strong, but I was seriously downsizing for a major move and decided to replace them with an ""everything"" shoe so I could own less stuff.

  
I wanted the oxford-style docs in real leather with nonslip soles. They can be dressed up or down, fit my day-to-day style, act as my rain shoes, and I could get away with wearing them to my full time job as a restaurant server, whereas doc boots are sometimes seen as too casual/edgy for more formal dress codes. Instead of having dress shoes, work shoes, and casual/all-weather shoes, I could just have one pair! And I love them! They work for me and I've found that highly cushioned shoes make my feet cramp up and my lower back hurt. I can walk a lot of miles in those things. I did a lot of research on them to see what others thought of them for restaurant work, and it seems that front of house folks tend to like them, while most of the negative opinions came from back of house workers who do a lot of standing in one spot and deal with extremely slippery greasy floors-- which isn't what my shifts look like.

  
Turns out they were at one point a tiktok microtrend, and I got them on depop for half the price of buying them new! They definitely had not been worn more than once or twice, if at all.

  
I wear them at LEAST 4-5 times a week, am constantly spilling drinks on them, and stomp around (I have a HEAVY step) on literal concrete floors for 6+ hours and an average of about 5 miles/10,000 steps per shift. They're my rain and snow shoes (it snowed twice this year and it was only about 2 inches). It's been about a year and a half now, and there's some wearing of the lining in the heel which doesn't seem to be getting any worse so I think that's just how my feet ""break in"" shoes. It seems I only need to clean/condition them twice a year with a damp paper towel and a bit of wonder balsalm which I borrowed from a friend because that single can will probably last a lifetime, so why buy two?

  
Crazy to me, as a former alt-kid and current queer person, that docs could be a microtrend. In my mind, they're just... standard shoes... that have been staples within these subcultures for generations...

  
Also, ugg mini's are a former microtrend that I have been hoping to thrift for the past 2 years. It's SO funny to me that they're in every single de-influencing video ever made. I'm 26 and I still wear my ""chestnut"" tall uggs from 8th grade folded ALL the way down so they're super fluffy. The mini's just have the power to work with more styles of pants than the tall or regulars, and as much as I love my fluffy uggs, they are a very LOUD wardrobe piece. It will be much easier to get away with wearing ugg mini's in more \~serious\~ settings. Also, I'm nostalgic for dark brown uggs because my first pair of uggs from 4th grade were regular height in the ""chocolate"" color. I hate that the quality has definitely gone down since the 2000's and early 2010's, but something about the very specific (some would say ugly) shape of uggs just does something for my soul that the other brands of sheepskin boots cannot touch.

  
Another BIFL microtrend that's a forever & always for me is the selkie ""puff"" dress dupe. I had wanted a selkie dress since 2020, and got a dupe to wear to the eras tour in 2024. I also wore it to my grad school graduation. And to the wicked premier. And I wish I had more excuses to wear it like all the time. I never grew out of the dress-up princess phase. And if I got my grubby little paws on one of those viral strawberry dresses from a while back, I'd probably make it my entire personality until the day I die. Okay, now I'm just giving myself more reasons why I definitely need to commit to learning to sew.

  
Not sure if Chunks hair clips would be considered a microtrend, but I've been wanting a checkered claw clip since 2020. Had a cheap dupe from target that I got rid of during one of my moves because at that point I had cut my hair short and had no use for claw clips. Regrew my hair and have been using another target claw clip, which broke from simply leaning my head against the couch. Finally bit the bullet on buying a real chunks clip after 5 years of wanting them (they're made with a more flexible/durable material), and ended up getting the exact one I wanted on sale with the added 10% welcome discount. I recently nailed down ""my"" color palette of what looks and feels best with my natural coloring, and got the clip in those colors (which have been some of my favorite colors most of my life anyway), and I'm very pleased with this BIFL purchase that I finally got after being in love with for 5 whole years."

Since they didn't post my review on their website I consider it's fair to post it here. I've purchased their latest Matte Black kettle. Overall I'm satisfied with the product but unfortunately their description is intentionally fuzzy for them to claim that *only steel* comes in contact with the water. They try to dance around the fact that water stays below the max level and *technically* doesn't touch the plastic lid which is a ridiculous statement to make, since it's obviously going to boil there and touch everything what's inside. When pressed, the customer support actually admits it:

>The inside of the lid features an inner-lid structure made from food-grade BPA-free plastic. Importantly, the water inside the kettle only comes into contact with stainless steel, and the silicone rubber is used around the temperature sensor seal. Any steam condensation inside may touch the silicone rubber and plastic parts of the lid.

Other than that, it's a very stylish, quiet and fast kettle, pity they took a shortcut in a 95% otherwise perfect product.

I've worn it in the ocean, I've worn it golfing, I've worn it in the pool. It always comes out looking perfect. I occasionally wash it on a gentle cycle with minimal detergent and hung it to dry, exactly as the care instructions recommend.

Early in May, I noticed there was a yellow-ish coating flaking off, and when I pinched it to pull it off, a 2"" x 2"" section of the exterior material came with it. The outer lining of the hat has essentially disintegrated in this one section.

The inner lining in the cap still proudly displays ""guaranteed for life"".

Tilley's website doesn't have a claims section, so I submitted a general inquiry regarding their lifetime guarantee.

Each response from them takes, on average, 4 business days.

> Response: Yep, your hat falls within our guarantee. Please send us photos.

I send photos.

> Response (4 days later): My system is showing zero availability in your size. We can put you on a notification list if and when those sizes become available. You're welcome to select a different style hat, as well.

I can't tell if this is a slow bot, or just crappy customer care. Probably both. I've asked for a credit in the amount of a new hat so I can purchase locally. They've yet to respond. 

So here I sit with a broken hat and zero resolution after almost 3 weeks of communicating with them.

Great product ruined by private equity.","I've been perfectly pleased with my Tilley AirFlo hat for the 6 years I've owned it. I've worn it in the ocean, I've worn it golfing, I've worn it in the pool. It always comes out looking perfect. I occasionally wash it on a gentle cycle with minimal detergent and hung it to dry, exactly as the care instructions recommend.

Early in May, I noticed there was a yellow-ish coating flaking off, and when I pinched it to pull it off, a 2"" x 2"" section of the exterior material came with it. The outer lining of the hat has essentially disintegrated in this one section.

The inner lining in the cap still proudly displays ""guaranteed for life"".

Tilley's website doesn't have a claims section, so I submitted a general inquiry regarding their lifetime guarantee.

Each response from them takes, on average, 4 business days.

> Response: Yep, your hat falls within our guarantee. Please send us photos.

But somehow, nothing got ruined. The notebook’s cover repelled the coffee like it had a built-in raincoat, and even the first page dried without any warping. What really surprised me though was my phone. The coffee just beaded up and rolled off the screen. I realized I hadn’t even installed the ESR Armorite screen protector yet, it was just sitting on top while I was getting ready to apply it. Still saved my phone.



So yeah, apparently both the notebook and the screen protector make decent spill guards when it counts. I’ve half-jokingly started keeping them nearby like backup coasters.

Anyways, this fridge is great at keeping food fresh, but it has two features I just can't figure out. One button beside the temperature dial that can be flipped between ""econo"" and ""humid"". And another doodah on the top right back interior wall that says ""cold injection"".

Does anyone know what these do?

1l4haso,Falke Socks - A 15-year Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1l4haso/falke_socks_a_15year_review/,3,2,1749176574.0,breppppp,"TLDR: Most Falke products are no longer BIFL

I have been wearing Falke socks over the past 15 years - models include business and casual models like Airport, Tiago & Sensitive London as well as more sport oriented socks like Cool 24/7 and Run. I know the product line really well - I was buying it before it was really ever available in the US - my German relatives introduced me to Falke as ""the Mercedes of socks."" I used to LOVE Falke.

Over time, I narrowed my interest to the Airport sock - to me it was the perfect sock. Merino wool blend so it actually performed well in a hiking application for hot weather, but it can be worn for business and casual. Somewhere around the time that Falke started appearing at Nordstrom, Shopbop etc. I noticed small changes - one time the cardboard label listed the correct size but the sock was labeled differently. I started to wonder if holes were appearing in the toe and heel area sooner than they used to.

As the years passed, it was harder to find Falke Airport socks at great prices. You could typically find them for $10-$15 if you waited for sales (they're now $30/pair). Once I started to question the quality, I also noticed that the socks were no longer made in Germany and in my last order, I purchased some Run socks (made in Slovakia) and Airport socks (made in Turkey). The Run socks (cotton/poly blend) were noticeably better made.

Yesterday, I received an order of socks directly from the Falke store. Most US-based retailers sell the cheaper lines like Run and Happy and I was concerned that the decrease in quality that I was imagining might be because the non-Falke retailers I had bought from in the past (e.g., HisRoom, etc) might be selling me second quality socks.

I opened the order and the size of the socks immediately jumped out to me. This entire 15 year period I've always worn a 45-46 size and all 5 pairs in my order were around 1 inch longer in the foot than my existing Airport socks. I opened one pack and tried the pair on and this wasn't an issue of shrinkage. The footbed of the sock is considerably larger than it used to be. More concerningly, the new Airport socks were substantially thinner than any of my older socks. You would think that 1-2 years of wearing and washing would have made the older socks thinner but it was not the case. I actually have a high-tolerance gauge in my garage that I bought from a electronics manufacturer and I'm tempted to break it out and see how much millimeters thinner the new socks are.

At any rate, the Run socks still seem potentially worth buying, but my holy grail sock - the Airport - is now an absolute piece of crap compared to what it once was. Falke should be absolutely embarrassed that they've increased their prices while outsourcing manufacturing to lower cost countries that cannot make the sock the correct size, nor produce it to the spec that it once was. Unfortunately I've seen similar declines in quality with once venerable European undergarment manufacturers like Calida and Hanro.

At this point, I will likely return to Rohner - I haven't seen many recommend this brand but its not bad and a much more refined product to Darn Tough which are well made socks but in my humble opinion are not well suited for more business or casual applications.","TLDR: Most Falke products are no longer BIFL

I want to take a long trip all over the country, and I wanna store all, if not most, of my personal data and files, I also plan to format my computer and I need to get an HDD asap nontheless.

**Currently I use around 1500 GB to 1TB of data all over my platforms.**

(I am very strict and worried about losing my data, all of it is on various SSD's.)

I know that my best chance of keeping my data is backing it up on iCloud, Online Drive etc...

But I am also willing to keep it on an external HDD. I heard that the **WD Elements HDD**'s are some of the finest.

**What is more realible, in terms of safety? and why?**

2x 2TB HDD (and split my current 2tb of data between them, or make copies)

or

1x 4TB HDD (and just trust on this one for the long run)

My ambition is to store it in a room for a long time (around 1-2 years). so please take note.

I recently had a problem with my brother label printer as a small business owner. I use 4x6 labels to print shipping labels like every other Shipping Company. I have printed thousands of labels through this printer. I purchased it about 9 months ago and so the warranty for one year should cover it, I troubleshoot it for about 2 hours with support, and they assure me that I will be sent another one as the warranty is still valid. 

The problem was that it would print one label and then feed out like two and a half labels and then when I cut the label. It would feed and cut off a small portion of the leading label.

Two days later I receive a call telling me that my warranty will be revoked because our labels are not the correct size I measured them they are 4x6. I'm now being gas lit by support saying that our labels are not the correct size. How would they know that?

What really makes them BIFL-worthy? Besides the longevity, I once had a pair that *did* eventually wear thin around the heel, and the warranty process was painless. Sent them in, got a replacement in the mail a week later. No questions asked.

Highly recommend for anyone who wants something as rugged as it is reliable.","I bought my first pair of Darn Tough socks in 2014, mostly out of curiosity after reading about their lifetime guarantee.

1l3i0du,My birthday is coming up. What brand of Sandals should I ask for?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1l3i0du/my_birthday_is_coming_up_what_brand_of_sandals/,16,71,1749073396.0,easternbetta,"I have no sandals. No joke. All I have is doc martens, converse, and heels. I've never had a pair of sandals that I like to wear for everyday, and its time to invest. I don't need hiking grade sandals necessarily, but I'm on my feet all day at work so I need them to be comfortable long-term with no blistering. 
Style-wise, I prefer a high ankle in nearly all of my footwear (I wear boots just about every day) and that carries over to my sandals preferences aswell,  like gladiator types i guess. I like the look plus it feels more secure.
A friend let me borrow her doc marten sandals, but I don't love them. I wear an 8.5, and since docs doesn't make half sizes, they're not ideal. The thick soles do feel quite nice though 😂

Price range is up to about $120 USD

Anyone have thoughts?","I have no sandals. No joke. All I have is doc martens, converse, and heels. I've never had a pair of sandals that I like to wear for everyday, and its time to invest.
