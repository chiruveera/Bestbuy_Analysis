I guess you’re posting here because BIFL implies the best quality products you can find - and in the case of running shoes, best isn’t necessarily longest durability, which BIFL almost always is.

Your first priority with running shoes is to find the best fitting shoes for your particular feet - fit & comfort outweigh any other criteria here. 

Then consider the cushioning best suited for your type of run. Trail shoes vs racing shoes are pretty different, and the best racing shoes actually have pretty low mileage for their price, but I would absolutely consider them best for that purpose. 

Cosmetics also matter, so choose something you like and be willing to pay extra. Wearing a good look will motivate you to go out and run. It’s silly, but true. 

As someone else said: ask r/running and they’ll have a far better answer than mine, with actual brands and models to recommend. But know you won’t be buying BIFL shoes - you should actually want to replace them often because it ensures integrity of vital support to your feet, legs, knees, hips and back - and frequent replacement means you’re going out often and getting in good shape and health.","BIFL is not the place to ask, but I will chime in to help your search forward.

The overflow problem can be caused by a too-dense filter. But that's probably not the problem if you're using actual Bunn filters.

Two possibilities from my experiences:

1. Your grind is too fine. Have you changed your grind recently? Your brand, if you're buying ground coffee?
2. Your water has changed. I think water with a high mineral content causes this. But in the end it's a flow rate problem. Bunn will provide you — for free — with a different sprayer that reduces the flow rate. You just gotta ask for it. No more overflow.

mx4ris5,1l8a467,DorothyAt40,"Typically, people choose to replace the dryer just so it matches the washing machine. But at the end of the day, a dryer is a dryer is a dryer. They haven't gone through as intense a change mechanically over the years as washing machines and they will typically outlast a washer by at least twice the time if not longer. You can always maintenance a dryer somewhat regularly, where you can't really do that with a washer so you can really keep it alive for a long time. 

These days, top load washing machines last about 8-10 years, and front loads last about 6-8 years. There's always some plus/minus variance in there of course.   
  
What makes a ""good"" washer is going to depend on what you want. One condensed way of looking at it is that if you want a front load, look for something that's direct drive rather than belt driven. 

With that said, I'm a Speed Queen girlie all the way. I don't have a lot of familiarity with front loads, I was just getting out of the repair game about when those came out, but I love a Speed Queen top load and have been using one for the last 10 years. They're about as close to getting a Maytag 30 years ago (and would still be working today). Speed Queen also has one of the better warranties, especially on parts. 

I personally prefer my appliances without computers (so dial timers) when I can because computers are expensive to replace and can so easily be the cause of many, many issues. 

Now that's me. Usually when people ask me this question, they follow up by sending me a picture of a red frontload because it's pretty and asking me what I think of it. 

If you want to get a front load, I'd go with a direct drive Maytag or even an LG. LG parts are pretty reasonable if/when you do need repairs and while finding a servicer can be difficult depending on where you live, the actual LG support will set all that up and often end up covering things beyond warranty. 

Don't get a Samsung. Samsung is good at electronics. They know how to make a TV and they know how to make a phone. They do not know how to make appliances. And have problems. Their parts NLA all the time (no longer available) and the parts are not cheap when they are available. Their customer service will fight for you, but finding authorized servicers is a nightmare because most repair people don't want to deal with them, or their known issues.","Typically, people choose to replace the dryer just so it matches the washing machine.

mwzbs2a,1l6unfl,JK7ray,"I would suggest getting some experience with secondhand wool sweaters, such as from thrift stores or ebay. The quality of older knits is generally higher than what's offered in stores now, and it's be a much cheaper way to learn your preferences when it comes to wool knits.

My experience from having bought way too many secondhand wool sweaters and also from hand-knitting is that shetland wool and lambswool are both substantially hardwearing. I use a thrifted lambswool pullover for winter yardwork, for example. In my experience merino has nowhere near the durability, but perhaps really expensive merino (like the Filson sweater) would be more durable.

Be aware that occasional mending is basically always necessary with 100% wool, and it's a skill anyone can learn and quite possibly even enjoy. There's also the necessity to appropriately care for your wool, e.g. using wool detergent (regular detergent eats protein, and wool is protein), hand-washing or using a very gentle cycle with cool water, and air-drying. It is a shift from 'regular' laundry, but not any more difficult especially since wool needs far less washing than, say, the Better Sweater (so, wool is actually easier, I think).

Since you mentioned ""hard wearing,"" you might consider blends such as 80% wool 20% nylon or even 50/50 wool/polyester. Since Patagonia prioritizes durability (e.g. without the need for mending), most of their wool clothing is a blend such as those two examples. Even though I'd generally prefer 100% wool, I have Patagonia 50/50 blends in both baselayers and an outer layer (a felted wool-poly pullover) and both are fantastic. There are also various treatments, such as ""superwash,"" which alter the wool to give it more resistance to shrinkage or felting. Here too I theoretically prefer natural wool but superwash wool, such as from Ibex, can also be great too. (Incidentally, Ibex does make a henley, though it is lightweight at 195gsm.) Patagonia makes a ""woolyester"" fabric you might look into.","I would suggest getting some experience with secondhand wool sweaters, such as from thrift stores or ebay.

mws4o0f,1l6ugsv,anthrazithe,"I had an Everki backpack before, changed it to a Timbuk2 and finally to a Tom Bihn Synik. I am settled with it for 3 years and the foreseeable future. :)

Everki was nice for the 2 padded compartments, notebook + tablet. But it also started to disintegrate after the 3 year mark. Good, but not a long term solution.

Timbuk2 makes great backpacks, but they are a bit lower on the usability side for me. Nothing exceptionally bad but somewhat annoying on the long run, like one less strap, somewhat illogical arrangement, etc. I still use it when I move around things with bicycle, I think they are a good choice for a less businessy/outdoorsy/rugged environment.

Tom Bihn looks a bit too much old school rugged, but the amount of small details and construction compensates for it. Buy 1-2 inner bags for it, attach them to the o-rings with carabiners and you are set. Expensive however, especially if you'd like to buy matching duffel bags, etc.

My advice would be, don't buy a large backpack if you don't need to. If you use 13"" notebooks, don't go for one that can fit 16""-s, instead get another duffel bag if you need to haul more stuff.","I had an Everki backpack before, changed it to a Timbuk2 and finally to a Tom Bihn Synik.

I have over a decade in the dental industry (i have since left) but for an at-home application you won’t do better than “Sheer White”.

You may be able to source them (grey market/fell off a truck) on eBay/Amazon. But ideally they’re bought from your dentist. $50-75 for a kit of 20 IIRC. But they come in different pack sizes. These are the best around in my opinion because they’re gentler on teeth. Many OTC options use a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide (crest white strips for example) which does work well, but  actually causes tooth sensitivity afterwards. SW uses 20% Carbamide peroxide which turns into hydrogen peroxide in the mouth, but at a much lower concentration than competitors.

I’ve also found that the SW strips themselves are more comfortable while in use. They’re thinner than others, while having a thicker “paste” that helps them stay in place during your session.

Edit: While we’re on the topic, I would also avoid whitening toothpaste like the plague. It uses abrasives that can actually cause more harm than good. At a certain point it will wear down your enamel and expose your dentin, which is yellow! and cause extreme sensitivity. Use it moderately.

mwqfv86,1l6od0f,MercuryMechanic,"I’ve worked on boats for years. Fixed everything from small jon boats to big offshore rigs. A lot of people get excited and rush into buying a boat without knowing what to look for. Here’s the stuff I always tell friends before they drop cash on something that’s going to give them problems.
First, figure out what you want the boat for. If you’re just fishing lakes or rivers, you don’t need a giant deep-V hull. A small aluminum boat or bass boat like a Lund or Tracker will do fine. If you’re taking the family out for fun and cruising, something like a Bennington or Manitou pontoon is nice and comfortable. Want to go fast and offshore? You’ll want a center console like a Sea Hunt, Robalo, or Grady-White.
Now the hull that’s a big one. Don’t let the paint fool you. Look underneath the boat. I always stomp around the deck to see if it’s soft. I’ve pulled up floors with rot under clean carpet. Tap around the transom too if it sounds hollow or soft, walk away. If it’s aluminum, check for cracked welds or corrosion. People try to patch stuff and hide it, so look close.

Engines are where most people lose money. I’ve seen motors that start fine but are about to die inside. Ask how many hours are on it, and more importantly, ask for service records. Pull the dipstick and smell the oil. If it smells burnt or looks milky, that’s trouble. Cold start it. See if it smokes, shakes, or sounds off. Don’t trust anyone who says “it just needs a tune-up.” That’s usually BS.
Check every switch and button on the dash. Horn, bilge pump, lights all of it should work. If nothing works, it probably means the wiring is a rat’s nest. I’ve crawled under dashes and seen home made jobs with duct tape and cheap wires. That stuff catches fire or kills batteries real fast.
Look in the bilge. If it’s full of old water, oil, or wires just floating around, that’s a red flag. Same with the fuel system make sure the tank isn’t rusty or leaking, and that the lines aren’t dry rotted. I’ve replaced entire fuel systems for people who didn’t check that.
If it comes with a trailer, check it too. Don’t forget about that. Make sure the bunks fit the hull. Check for rust, bad tires, and working lights. A bad trailer will ruin your weekend fast.
Paperwork is important. I’ve had people try to register boats with missing titles big headache. Make sure the HIN on the boat matches the title, and same for the trailer and motor. No paperwork? Don’t buy it.

If you’re going used, just be ready to spend money fixing stuff. That “great deal” often isn’t. I’ve had guys bring me boats that they got cheap but needed thousands in repairs.

Now if you’re looking for a new boat and don’t want to overpay, check out Novielli Boats. I’ve seen them in person. Honestly, they’re solid builds, they come with brand new Mercury motors, and they look sharp. But the big thing is the price you’re getting a custom built boat for way less than most used boats I work on. They’re a smart buy, especially if you want performance without getting ripped off.
There’s a lot of good brands out there. Grady White, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Bennington, Alumacraft, and Skeeter all solid. But don’t just buy for the name. Look at the condition, how it was taken care of, and whether it fits how you’ll actually use it.

Bottom line, take your time. Bring someone who knows boats. Don’t fall for shiny seats and Bluetooth radios. The boat underneath is what matters. Trust me, I’ve seen people smile at delivery and cry six months later. Don’t be that guy.","I’ve worked on boats for years. Fixed everything from small jon boats to big offshore rigs.

And that old myth about aluminum being loud? That’s Jon boat stuff. These are fully foam filled and runs silent, like a knife cutting through butter. You feel the difference the second you throttle up.  
  
This ain’t some cookie cutter production line crap. You can tell every inch of this thing was built by guys who give a damn and know what they’re doing. It’s rare these days to find a boat that feels engineered, not just assembled.

If you want gaming i can never recommend a laptop with a gaming GPU, even if it's the fastest one, it will just be massively more expensive and eventually obsolete in 3-5 years, just buy an external GPU dock ( thunderbolt connector needed ), upgrade every 5 years with a budget GPU, max out ram when needed, replace battery once at most and you can get a good 15 years out of laptop, while still gaming on it !

Key is upgradability!

PS : i just read that you were novice 
So you should look for this in a laptop :
High end CPU : Core ultra 9 
Ram : 16 or 32GB -- as for upgradability - at least 64GB capable 
Screen : it should be good if laptop costs more than 1000 dollars
GPU : doesn't matter, just buy the lowest end one ( keep things cheap )
Most important point : thunderbolt 4 or 5 port !!
For gaming : you will need to tinker if you want BIFL ( look for external GPU for laptops in the internet - combo will probably cost less than 400 dollars )","As other sead, laptops are not meant to last a long time, you would be lucky if they last as long as your phone ( if not upgraded ), they are just weaker structurally and strained by closed upgrade paths.. my advice is to buy a top of the line one in terms of CPU performance and ram upgradability, good screen, good build quality.

I got recommended it from this sub, and it is still to this day the best purchase I’ve made from here. I have not had a better shave from anything else I’ve tried.

Not only will the handle last a lifetime, but the blades are so cheap and last 2-3 clean shaves per side (can be stretched out, but honestly it’s so cheap you’re saving maybe pennies), with your current shaving needs you probably would only spend <$5 on blades per year.

If you never do it after that the hair starts to come back a little bit I think so I do it like once a month.,18,1749191079.0
mwaihzq,1l4kp91,SharkieMcShark,"I have an older-model Braun that I got on Gumtree (like the UK version of Craigslist), there were loads of options for unused or lightly used on there, because people get them and then don't use them, so I would totally recommend getting a second hand one. I suspect all the brands are basically the same, so I wouldn't worry too much about which one.

I have pale skin and dark hair, which they say is the optimal combo, and it's working fairly well. I've been using it approximately weekly for about 10 months, and I think a lot of the hair that remains is due to user error (lol) - because you shave first, there's no way to check if you've zapped all the hair, so I've missed some patches

I find it leaves me with a lovely smooth finish each time I use it, and it is definitely reducing the hair over time

I also have some tips on reducing razor burn if you're interested? Obvs use loads of lube (whether a specific shaving foam, or my preference, hair conditioner), and shave first is the direction of the hair growth, then 45 degrees either side, then 90 degrees either side, then 135, then finally against the grain. It takes a bit longer, but I find I get a much closer shave with no irritation. I also use a safety razor with a new blade, which I think helps a lot.","I have an older-model Braun that I got on Gumtree (like the UK version of Craigslist), there were loads of options for unused or lightly used on there, because people get them and then don't use them, so I would totally recommend getting a second hand one.

mw5wht6,1l43hhl,Purple_Musician_2755,"Dentist here- custom trays and gel tubes are the ultimate BIFL. The trays will last you forever unless you lose all your teeth or undergo orthodontics. 

Boring but important facts: Carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide are the only chemicals that are going to whiten your teeth effectively and safely. Carbamide peroxide breaks down into hydrogen peroxide slowly and will work for longer, plus it is more gentle as hydrogen peroxide can cause more sensitivity. Carbamide peroxide also has a longer shelf life although both can be refrigerated to help them last longer. 

Crest white strips have a much lower concentration of peroxide than the gel tubes or prefilled Opalescence Go trays so they work but will take longer. Neither of the prefilled trays allow for you to place the whitening agent exactly where to want it which is overkill. Prefilled trays are better than the strips because they’re made to be a little smaller than the Crest strips, but they’re more expensive and leave a lot of plastic waste. Custom trays in my opinion are the best overall as you can add gel to only the teeth that are visible in your smile, you can choose Carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide gel (available on Amazon), and overtime the tubes of gel are cheaper than anything else. 

All of the rest of the options are gimmicky: LED lights do not work, they just appear to make the teeth whiter by drying them out temporarily, charcoal does more harm because it is abrasive to enamel and will cause scratches that will get more surface staining over time, and pens and gels that just smear onto the teeth are just going to get come off of the teeth and get swallowed if there is nothing to hold them in place like a tray.  

Last: everyone’s teeth are going to whiten differently so comparing one persons use of white strips to another persons use of gel isn’t a good comparison as there are many factors that determine the colors of your teeth. The only way to compare products is to try them all yourself.","Dentist here- custom trays and gel tubes are the ultimate BIFL.

All of the rest of the options are gimmicky: LED lights do not work, they just appear to make the teeth whiter by drying them out temporarily, charcoal does more harm because it is abrasive to enamel and will cause scratches that will get more surface staining over time, and pens and gels that just smear onto the teeth are just going to get come off of the teeth and get swallowed if there is nothing to hold them in place like a tray.  

Last: everyone’s teeth are going to whiten differently so comparing one persons use of white strips to another persons use of gel isn’t a good comparison as there are many factors that determine the colors of your teeth. The only way to compare products is to try them all yourself.",328,1749142282.0

mw5vnmm,1l43hhl,ConBroMitch2247,"I have over a decade in the dental industry (i have since left) but for an at-home application you won’t do better than “Sheer White”. 

You may be able to source them (grey market/fell off a truck) on eBay/Amazon. But ideally they’re bought from your dentist. $50-75 for a kit of 20 IIRC. But they come in different pack sizes. These are the best around in my opinion because they’re gentler on teeth. Many OTC options use a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide (crest white strips for example) which does work well, but  actually causes tooth sensitivity afterwards. SW uses 20% Carbamide peroxide which turns into hydrogen peroxide in the mouth, but at a much lower concentration than competitors. 

I’ve also found that the SW strips themselves are more comfortable while in use. They’re thinner than others, while having a thicker “paste” that helps them stay in place during your session.

Edit: While we’re on the topic, I would also avoid whitening toothpaste like the plague. It uses abrasives that can actually cause more harm than good. At a certain point it will wear down your enamel and expose your dentin, **which is yellow!** and cause extreme sensitivity. Use it moderately. But find a non-whitening toothpaste for daily use.","I have over a decade in the dental industry (i have since left) but for an at-home application you won’t do better than “Sheer White”.
